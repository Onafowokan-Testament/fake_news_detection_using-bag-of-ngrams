# Fake News Detection with Machine Learning ðŸ“°

Welcome to the **Fake News Detection** project! This project focuses on classifying news articles as either "fake" or "true" using machine learning models. The dataset consists of news articles labeled as fake or true, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new articles. The project uses **scikit-learn** for building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer` for converting text into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Trains multiple machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using classification reports.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset containing news articles and their labels (fake or true).
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Convert the text data into numerical features using `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer`.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on the processed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using classification reports.

## Results

### Model Performance

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | 0.73     | 0.84      | 0.73   | 0.75     |
| Random Forest          | 0.XX     | 0.XX      | 0.XX   | 0.XX     |
| Naive Bayes            | 0.XX     | 0.XX      | 0.XX   | 0.XX     |

### Classification Report

The classification report provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each category.
